# Door-Lock-System
As thefts are increasing day by day security is becoming a major concern nowadays. In this project we will make a digital door lock system with keypad using Arduino Uno. It will open your door only when the right password is entered. Using a 4x4 keypad password is entered and if the password matches with the previously saved password, the door opens. In this project, the opening and closing of the door is shown with the help of a servo motor.
